## Who we are?

We are a group of professionals with a common vision to support agencies to provide quality education to socially and economically disadvantaged children at the Foundational Stage so that there is equity. We work towards this vision by supporting programmes for children of age group birth to eight years. 

We understand that programmes in public private partnerships are often at different stages of their evolution and face unique challenges to bring quality in them.  Our aim is to support these programme teams and provide high quality experiences to children as a routine, requires a multi-disciplinary approach. 

It requires all or some of these aspects – needs assessment; designing/contextualizing curriculum; capacity building and handholding for the teachers; providing teaching learning materials (TLMs) coordinated with the curriculum; a robust Monitoring and evaluation system, innovative ways of engaging with parents and caregivers; engaging with the government system; developing audio visual materials and other materials in the local language. Besides this, the support required also varies with the location of the programme - urban, rural and tribal settings. 

Anubhodh offers services to agencies through its team of multi-disciplinary professionals. We, Anjali Gokhale and Vidya Ghugari are senior contacts of this group.

## Our philosophy 

Learning in the early years (birth  to eight years) is a continuum with each sub-stage and this affects learning in the next sub-stage. Programmes which cover the entire span have far more impact than working at any one sub-stage. 
Research findings and theories on Child Development must be demystified so that even a semi-literate to illiterate teacher understands the scientific basis of what she is doing with children.  
 
A nurturing, safe and secure environment is of paramount importance for young children to start self-learning. We therefore believe that working with all the adults in a child centric environment - parents, other caregivers, teacher, and helper is crucial to create such an environment.
Adults around these young children must understand their roles and responsibilities in providing age appropriate experiences. We believe in developing a cadre of such caregivers who are invested in the children’ development. 
Another important aspect is staying connected with the field. It aids to the evolution of our programme and we can understand the grass root challenges while providing quality education. We believe that individuals at all levels must know how to work with children directly. 

## Vision Statement of Anubodh 

All children, particularly, from birth to 8 years, from disadvantaged sections of society should get appropriate and contextualized education and a stimulating environment from adults around them through which their inherent potentials flourish; they develop positive self-image; they learn to learn and become self-reliant civil society members. 

## Mission statement of Anubodh  

To empower caregivers and teachers from different backgrounds to create enabling environment and create learning opportunities for adults to make capable of implementing the mission of quality education. 

## Our approach

To empower caregivers, and teachers we have three folded approach.This includes three stages.
  1. Programme Designing and preparatory tasks.
  2. Programme execution.
  3. End-line assessment 


We begin with perspective building at the leadership level to help caregivers understand the quality of the programme. Their support and endorsement of the programme is important for the sustainability of the change.

Capacity building of teachers, co teachers, helpers and other adults is done through a combination of recurrent training, on-site support and mentoring. We also focus on capacity building of mentors. We believe that teachers and mentors besides acquiring skills in ECE, need to work on their beliefs, communication and leadership skills. We therefore include discussions on rational thinking, stress management, emotional regulation/management, and problem solving and mentoring. We refer to Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT) approach.

Our approach is to first provide a visual picture of a high-quality programme to the teachers through demonstration with children followed by understanding the necessary theoretical undergirding.

Monitoring the programme with SMART outcome indicators to track progress, provide data driven monitoring and mentoring helps to keep expected outcomes in focus.
